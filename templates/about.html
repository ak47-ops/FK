      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Understanding the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Score</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The Flesch-Kincaid (FK) readability score is a widely recognized metric used to assess the ease with which a reader can understand a given text. It calculates a grade-level score that represents the years of education a person needs to easily comprehend the content. For example, a score of 8 indicates that the text is easily understood by an eighth grader.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        This metric has become an essential tool for professionals across various industries. In the field of advertising and content creation, the FK score is invaluable because it helps tailor your message to your target audience. Content that is too complex may alienate potential customers, while overly simplified content might fail to capture the intended nuance or authority.
      </p>
